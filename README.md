# Cpp_Statement

Comments about the program:

calling 2 libraries of iostream and format

defining the usage the two statements format and cout so we dont have to call them everytime in our main function

inside our main, declare the variable x

now assigning it a vale of 40

then we call the library function format and assign its return value to str

finally, "cout" which prints the result for us.
